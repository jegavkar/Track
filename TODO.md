# Currency Conversion Implementation - COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Added currency conversion logic to services.py
- [x] Added EXCHANGE_RATES dictionary with fixed rates
- [x] Added convert_to_inr function to convert prices based on domain
- [x] Modified update_product_price to convert scraped prices to INR before storing
- [x] All new product prices are now stored in INR

## Implementation Details
- **Exchange Rates Used:**
  - Amazon.com (USD): 1 USD = 83 INR
  - Amazon.in (INR): 1:1 (no conversion)
  - Flipkart.com (INR): 1:1 (no conversion)
  - Best Buy (USD): 1 USD = 83 INR
- **Default Behavior:** If domain not recognized, assume price is already in INR
- **Storage:** All prices in database are now stored in INR
- **Display:** Product history template already shows â‚¹ symbol, now prices are correctly in INR

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Make exchange rates configurable in settings.py
- [ ] Add dynamic exchange rate fetching from APIs
- [ ] Update existing products' prices if needed (migration might be required)
